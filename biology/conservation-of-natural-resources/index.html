         As we all know that everything in this <span class="word-count-mobile">life has its</span> own period <span class="word-count-desktop">of existence, as a result we need </span>to find a way to ensure their (natural resources) availability or existence and that's what bring us to the study of conservation of natural resources.
       <h3>What did you understand by the word conserve?</h3>
       <p>
        Conserve simply means to save something for later use or to protect something. Conservation means wise use of something. Now let define it in relation to natural resources.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>Conservation of Natural Resources</b> can be defined as the process of saving or making judicious use of natural resources to ensure their continuous availability and to preserve their natural quality for future purposes.

       Natural resources are materials from the earth that are used to support life and meet people's need. Example of natural resources are coal, copper, raw materials for production of goods, food, soil, water wildlife e.t.c.
      </p>
       <h3>Types of Natural Resources</h3>
      <p>There are renewable and non-renewable resources</p>
      <section class="descr-list">
       <h4>Renewable Resources</h4>
       <p>This are resources that are replaced by the environment over relatively short periods of time. Examples of renewable resources are water, air, animal,  plant, food, soil.  All these can be replenished by natural processses, so there is no fear of being used up. For example,  water can be replenished by rainfall.</p>
       
       <h4>Non-Renewable Resources</h4>
       <p>This resources that are not easily replaced by the environment. Petroleum, oil, coal and many mineral resources falls to this category.<br>
       <b>Note</b> Most non-renewable resources are formed from organic carbon which is heated and compressed over a long period of time.</p>
      </dl>
     </section>
      
      <h3>Needs for Conservation</h3>
      <p>
       The following are the reasons for conserving natural resources:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>To create biodiversity;</li>
       <li>To keep them for future purposes;</li>
       <li>To preserve their natural qualities;</li>
       <li>To save water.</li>
      </ul>
     </div>
    </section>
    
    <section class="main-note-section third-note-section">
     <h2>Methods of Conservation
     </h2>
     <div>
      <h3>Soil Conservation</h3>
      <p>
       Once the vegetation cover has been removed, the soil will be exposed to wind, rain and other elements which leads to the gradual washing away of the top soil (that is, erosion). This causes soil degradation; soil degradation is the fall in the soil quality. Soil degradation is also caused by bush burning, overgrazing, excessive use of fertilizers or manure and unsustainable farming practices.
      </p>
      <section class="image-box"> 
       <img src="../../web-assets/images/biology/eroded-land.jpeg" alt="a man standing by an eroded land" width="85%">
       <p>Soil erosion is a typical example of soil degradation.</p>
      </section>
      <p>
       The following are ways to prevent soil degradation:
      </p>
      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
        <li><b>Planting of trees</b> because trees serves as windbreaks to prevent soil from being blown away by wind and also to prevent desertification;</li>
        <li><b>Good farming practices</b> such as contour ploughing to reduce run off and loss of topsoil;</li>
        <li><b>Crop-rotation and planting of cover crops</b> should be adopted so as to ensure availability of soil nutrients;</li>
        <li><b>Bushing burning</b> should be discouraged as it causes inactivity of essential soil microbes and death of essential soil organism like earthworms, termites;</li>
        <li>Avoid indiscriminate felling of trees (deforestation);</li>
        <li>Avoid soil pollution by oil spillage, excessive inorganic fertilizer and other industrial wastes.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Forest Conservation</h3>
      <p>
       Forest provide environmental, social and economic benefits to us but, despite this, inborn forest around us are still under threat from logging, clearing for agricultural, construction and industrial purposes.
      </p>
      <section class="image-box"> 
       <img src="../../web-assets/images/biology/bush-burning.JPG" alt="a bush burning" width="85%">
      <img src="../../web-assets/images/biology/fallen-trees.jpg" alt="a fallen tree" width="85%">
       <p>Bush burning (top) and deforestation (bottom) are the killers of our forest and its resources.</p>
      </section>
      <p>
       We need to appreciate the importance of forest and preserve it. Therefore, the method of conserving forest are as follow:
      </p>
      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
        <li>Encouraging afforestation and planting of trees;</li>
        <li>Establishment of forest reserves;</li>
        <li>Discouraging deforestation;</li>
        <li>Law should be made against discriminate falling of forest trees;</li>
        <li>Appreciate its importance and enlightened others about the value of forest.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Water Conservation</h3>
      <p>
        One of the basic unit of life is water for there's no living organism that can survive in its absence. The methods of conserving this indispensable resources are:
      </p>
      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
        <li>Prevention of water pollution</li>
        <li>Rational use of ground water such as water from well,  borehole;</li>
        <li>Repair of burst pipe and leakage;</li>
        <li>Treatment and recycling of used water.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Wildlife Conservation</h4>
      <section class="image-box"> 
       <img src="../../web-assets/images/biology/Yankari_Elephants.jpg" alt="elephant in a game reserve" width="85%">
       <p>Elephants; an example of wildlife.</p>
      </section>
      
      <p>These are animals that live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. <br>The method of preserving wildlife are:
      </p>
      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
        <li>Establishment of game reserve;</li>
        <li>Prohibition of discriminate killing or poaching of wild animals;</li>
        <li>Prohibition of deforestation and encouragement of afforestation;</li>
        <li>Preventing of water pollution to prevent the destruction of aquatic life;</li>
        <li>Appreciating their importance and creating awareness on the values of wildlife</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Conservation of Mineral Resources</h3>
      <p>This is the only non-renewable resources on our list. But its used has to be properly controlled because once they are exhausted, they can't be replaced. And some of them takes thousands to millions of years to build up.
      </p>
      <p>The methods of conserving mineral resources are:
      </p>
      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
        <li>Recycling of metal using metal scraps;</li>
        <li>Reduce wastage in the process of mining;</li>
        <li>Over-dependance on a particular mineral resources should be discouraged;</li>
        <li>Used of improved technologies to allow the use of low-grade ores at low costs.</li>
      </ol>
      <section class="image-box"> 
       <img src="../../web-assets/images/biology/coal.jpg" alt="coal" width="85%">
       <p>Coal is an example of mineral resources (fossil fuel) used to power train engines.</p>
      </section>
      <h3>Air Conservation</h3>
      <p>This is another important resources for survival of both plant and animals as it contains oxygen O<sub>2</sub> and carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub>.
       </p>
       <p>Methods of conserving air includes:</p>
       <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
         <li>Encourage afforestation because plants gives out oxygen during photosynthesis;</li>
         <li>Prevent air pollution by industries;</li>
         <li>Regular car service to  prevent air pollution;</li>
         <li>Preventing bush burning</li>

     <h2>Summary</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Conservation of Natural Resources is the management of natural resources in a way that ensures that they are used efficiently and less waste is produced
      </li>
      <li>
       Work is said to be done when a force causes an object to move through a certain distance in the direction of the force.
       </li>
      <li>Many of our renewable and non-renewable natural resources are being threatened by human activities.
      </li>
      <li>
       Renewable resources are natural resources such as fish , forest, air, solar energy and water.
       </li>
       <li>
        Non-renewable resources are things such as fossil fuels that cannot be used over and over again.
       </li>
       <li>
        Environmental concerns and challenges can be addressed through conservation and effective management of natural ecological processes. A range of conservation measures approaches may be employed to address environmental problems and challenges. These include reducing consumption, soil conservation, management of protected areas, water conservation and afforestation.
       </li>
       <li>
        There are several national park and reserves in Nigeria and there are several international and local conservation agencies that work with Nigeria.
